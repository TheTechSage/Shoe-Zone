# Shoe Zone App ( in React + Vite)

This app was created as a React Personal Project.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Clone the project & enter in your terminal: 
<code>npm i</code> or <code>npm install</code> and you're ready to go.

Also the app has light and dark themes depending on your browser's selected theme. 
For e.g. you have selected light theme for your browser, when you open this app by copy pasting the link in your browser it will automatically open with light-theme. And if you change your browser's theme to dark, the app's theme will also automatically change to dark immediately.
