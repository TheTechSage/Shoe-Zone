# Shoe Zone App ( in React + Vite)

This app was created as a React Personal Project with vite.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

-> To run the project you should have Node.js installed.

-> Then clone/download the project locally & change your current directory to the 'Shoe-Zone' directory in your terminal by using <code>cd</code> command, then :
<code>npm i</code> or <code>npm install</code> to install all dependencies.

The app has light and dark themes which depends on your browser's selected theme. 

- For e.g. your browser has light theme by default, so when you open the app it will automatically open with light-theme. And if you change your browser's theme to dark, the app's theme will also automatically change to dark immediately.
